# Metadata fields by category
These are the fields that will be in use in EDITH/ResourceSpace. Some of them are editable, some are not, and of course not all will be applicable to all types of media being ingested into the system. FYI, this listing doesn’t include any of the technical metadata that is harvested and stored separately.

For PFA collection items that have records in FileMaker, the intention is that you won’t need to add any extra metadata during ingest. Other fields can be edited on the ingest screen.

These are the categories of fields:

[General fields](#general-fields)

[PFA Film collection fields](#pfa-film-collection-fields)

[Event-driven fields](#event-driven-fields)

[Communications fields](#communications-fields)

[System fields](#system-fields)
